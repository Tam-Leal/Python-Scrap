The Project
-

The idea of this project is to analyze and evaluate the sale prices of pieces of meat in virtual stores. For previously registered locations, it is possible to evaluate prices of a product segment at any time. In this case, beef. This tool assists in data processing and facilitates visualization. It is still possible to filter specific products after all the data is in the base.
